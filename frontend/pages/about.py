    ## Our Mission üéØ
    
    We're dedicated to helping farmers and gardeners worldwide identify and treat plant diseases quickly and accurately. 
    Our AI-powered system democratizes access to agricultural expertise, making professional-grade plant disease 
    diagnosis available to everyone with a smartphone or computer.
    
    ## How It Works üî¨
    
    Our system uses advanced **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** trained on thousands of plant disease images 
    to provide accurate disease identification. Here's the process:
    
    1. **Image Capture**: You upload or capture a photo of the affected plant leaf
    2. **Preprocessing**: Our system enhances and prepares the image for analysis
    3. **AI Analysis**: A deep learning model analyzes the image for disease patterns
    4. **Disease Identification**: The system identifies the most likely disease with confidence scores
    5. **Treatment Recommendations**: Comprehensive treatment and prevention advice is provided

    ### For Best Results:
    - **Image Quality**: Use clear, well-lit photos with good focus
    - **Leaf Coverage**: Ensure the leaf fills most of the frame
    - **Multiple Angles**: Take photos from different angles if possible
    - **Natural Lighting**: Avoid harsh shadows or artificial lighting when possible
    - **Clean Background**: Remove clutter from the background
    
    ### Limitations:
    - **Accuracy**: While highly accurate, the system is not 100% perfect
    - **New Diseases**: May not recognize very rare or newly discovered diseases
    - **Image Quality**: Poor quality images will result in lower accuracy
    - **Professional Advice**: Always consult agricultural experts for severe infections
    
    ### Disclaimer:
    This tool provides AI-based suggestions for educational and informational purposes. 
    For critical agricultural decisions or severe plant infections, please consult with 
    qualified agricultural professionals or extension services.
